# Creating and Deploying a Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure

## Introduction
In this project, I created and deployed a Virtual Machine (VM) within the Microsoft Azure cloud.

## Steps

### Step 1: Sign in to Microsoft Azure
First, I signed into my Microsoft Azure account and navigated to the Virtual Machine section to start creating the VM.

### Step 2: Add VM to Resource Group
I added the VM to my Resource Group named **"Azure-Practice"** and named the VM **Windows-VM**. The VM is located within the same region as my Resource Group, which is (US) East US 2.

### Step 3: Set Credentials
I created a password and a username for the VM to access it later.

### Step 4: Review and Create
After reviewing the settings, I successfully created the VM.

### Step 5: Deploy the Virtual Machine
In the final step, I deployed the Virtual Machine. Here, we can see it is working properly, and we can also check that the IP address of the machine matches the overview in Azure.

### Step 6: VM Overview
In this section, you can see the overview of the newly created VM with its respective public IP address: `74.249.102.225`.

### Step 7: Deploying the VM
In the final step of the project, I deployed the Virtual Machine and here we can see
its working properly, and we can also check the IP address of the machine matches
from the overview in Azure.

## Project Overview
This project allowed me to create and deploy a virtual machine using Microsoft Azure. By creating this VM and placing it within my Azure-Practice resource group, I have more control and disposition of this resource. Now, I can configure the Network Security Group (NSG), Firewall, install SQL servers, and more to continue my studies and understanding of Azure.
